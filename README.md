🎶 My First Year AI Project is Live! 🤖✨

For this project, I used the MidiCaps dataset from Hugging Face to build a Transformer-based model that generates music from user prompts 🎹📝
It takes in a text prompt and outputs a musical piece — all powered by AI 🎧🪄 (NO I DID NOT USE MusicLM)

📹 Check out a sample video of the model in action:

This project is completely free to use! 🆓
Credits are appreciated (not mandatory, but they do help keep me motivated 💪🙂)

I hope you all enjoy it! 💜
I'm also open to collaborations — feel free to reach out via LinkedIn or Discord 🤝🌍
